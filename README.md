# GitHub Actions Cache Presentation

This repository serves as a presentation for understanding and utilizing GitHub Actions Cache effectively.

## Getting Started

To set up the application, follow these steps:

1. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   . venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Start the application:
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app
   ```

## Application URLs

Once the application is running, you can explore the documentation and interact with it at [http://127.0.0.1/docs](http://127.0.0.1/docs).

## Testing the Application

To ensure the correctness of the application, run the tests using pytest:
```bash
pytest -v
```

This will execute the tests and provide detailed output, helping you verify that your application is functioning as expected.

## GitHub Actions Cache

GitHub Actions Cache is a powerful feature that helps optimize workflows by caching dependencies and build artifacts. By caching certain files or directories, you can significantly reduce the time it takes for your workflows to run, especially when dealing with large dependencies.

### Why Use GitHub Actions Cache?

- **Efficient Resource Utilization:** Caching helps optimize resource utilization by reusing previously downloaded or built artifacts.

- **Speed Up Workflows:** Caching prevents redundant downloads and installations of dependencies, speeding up your workflow execution.
